# Bigscreen Survey Frontend Instructions
- Always use English for all code, variables, and UI fields.
- Use camelCase or PascalCase for all variable, function, and class names.
- All methods and properties must be commented.
- The frontend must be ready to connect to a Laravel backend (API, validation, etc).
- The project is structured for: public survey, answer consultation, and admin (login, dashboard, questions, answers).
- Use modern React best practices (hooks, functional components, etc).
- Use open source chart libraries (e.g., Chart.js) for admin statistics.
- All forms must be validated according to backend rules.
